		{
			question: "What is an A1c?",
			answer:
				"A Hemoglobin A1c is a 2-3 month average of your blood sugars. This result gives you a good idea of how well your diabetes is being managed/controlled. The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1c of less than 7 to keep the risk of complications low.",
		},
		{
			question: "Why does it matter if my blood sugar is 120 or 200?",
			answer:
				"It is very important to keep your blood sugar level under control. When your blood sugar level is high, it can cause damage in your veins and arteries. This damage could lead to complications later such as heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, neuropathies, vision problems, etc.",

Many sugar free foods have calories and carbohydrates and lots of fat. Make sure you read the nutrition labels.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Can diabetes go away?",
			answer: `Currently no cure exists for diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is a deficiency of the pancreas to produce insulin, so insulin injections are necessary to sustain life. Type 2 diabetes is more common; the pancreas can produce some insulin, but not enough for the diet and size of the body, and/or the insulin functions poorly due to insulin resistance.

Research has shown that healthy lifestyle changes such as weight loss and exercise can decrease the need for medication for type 2 diabetes. Even if symptoms diminish and blood glucose measures normal, the disease is still present.

Your risk of complications of diabetes is lower if your blood glucose control is improved.`,
		},
		{
			question: "What are the signs of diabetes?",
			answer: `Many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. Some lose weight without trying. Additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. Some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Do I have to take insulin?",
			answer: `People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin to sustain life. People with type 2 diabetes either produce inadequate insulin or have insulin resistance (which means the cells have difficulty responding to insulin) or both. Treatment for type 2 usually begins with a change in diet and exercise. However, very overweight, inactive newly diagnosed people with diabetes may have such a high blood glucose level that they initially need insulin to bring blood glucose under control. Many people with type 2 diabetes can manage their diabetes with lifestyle changes and oral medications. Diabetes is a progressive disease, and in spite of a person’s best efforts, they may need insulin to control blood glucose at some time.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Does diabetes cause other complications?",
			answer: `If blood sugar is not kept in check, diabetes can lead to a number of serious complications, including heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, blindness, blood vessel disease that can require amputations, nerve damage and impotence in men. However, a recent study conducted over a 10-year period showed that patients can reduce the risk of complications by 50% or more when their blood sugar measures as close to normal as possible.

The best way to protect yourself from the serious complications of diabetes is to manage your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol and avoid smoking. Regular checkups and monitoring can help catch problems early. Managing your diabetes every day may seem hard, but it makes a huge difference in your long-term health.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Can I drink alcohol?",
			answer: `It is important to talk with your doctor about whether alcohol is safe for you. If you do choose to drink, do so occasionally and only when your blood sugar level is well controlled. Alcohol can cause low blood sugar levels soon after drinking and for up to 24 hours after drinking. It is a good idea to check your blood sugar before you drink and eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates while drinking.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Can I eat sweets and desserts?",
			answer: `Yes! Carbohydrates in food turn into glucose in the body. It is the total amount of carbohydrates you eat that affects blood glucose levels more than the source. That means you can eat a small portion of desserts, sweets or other foods with sugar as long as you work it into your meal plan and follow your prescribed medication. Always watch your portion size and try to eat sweets that are made with healthy fats such as olive oil instead of butter or shortening and with whole grain flour instead of white flour.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Should I be on a low carbohydrate diet?",
			answer: `Low-carb diets are not recommended for people with diabetes. Carbohydrates are the body’s main source of energy. Your body also needs carbohydrates to feed the brain and red blood cells and to protect against muscle loss. A balanced diet with carbohydrates from healthy sources (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and low-fat dairy products) is best. If you are trying to lose weight, cutting back on your portion sizes and calories is more effective than cutting out entire food groups.`,
		},
		{
			question: "How do I know how many carbs to eat?",
			answer: `The amount of carbs you should eat depends on your age, activity level, diabetes medicines and other medical conditions. Your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian can help you determine the right amount for you. Carbohydrate counting or consistent carbohydrate meal plans are the most common meal planning techniques used to help keep blood glucose levels within target range.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Do I need to take vitamins or supplements?",
			answer: `Most people with diabetes can get the nutrients they need through a healthy, balanced diet. There is no clear evidence that vitamin or mineral supplements improve blood sugar control. If you have a deficiency, your doctor may suggest a supplement. Do not take any supplements without talking to your provider, as some may interact with your medications or cause other problems.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Can stress affect my blood sugar?",
			answer: `Yes. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones that can cause blood sugar to rise. This is especially true in people with type 2 diabetes. Learning stress management techniques like deep breathing, yoga, meditation or talking with a counselor can help reduce stress and may improve your blood glucose control.`,
		},
		{
			question: "How often should I check my blood sugar?",
			answer: `This depends on your type of diabetes, your treatment plan, and your blood sugar goals. People who take insulin may need to check more often (before meals and at bedtime). Those managing with diet and exercise or oral medications may check less often. Your provider will recommend how often you should test and what your target range should be.`,
		},
		{
			question: "What should I do if my blood sugar is too high?",
			answer: `If your blood sugar is consistently high, review your diet, physical activity and medications. Make sure you are taking medications as prescribed, eating healthy, and being active. Drink water to help flush out excess sugar, and consider light activity like walking. Contact your healthcare provider if your levels stay high or if you are not feeling well.`,
		},
		{
			question: "What should I do if my blood sugar is too low?",
			answer: `Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can be dangerous. If your blood sugar is below 70 mg/dL, eat or drink 15 grams of fast-acting carbs (such as glucose tablets, juice, or regular soda). Recheck your blood sugar after 15 minutes and repeat if it is still low. Always carry a quick source of sugar and talk to your doctor about how to prevent lows.`,
		},
		{
			question: "Do I have to stop eating my favorite foods?",
			answer: `No! You can still enjoy your favorite foods in moderation. The key is to plan ahead, watch portion sizes, and balance your meals. Working with a dietitian can help you fit your favorite foods into a healthy meal plan.`,
		},
		{
			question: "What is the best way to prevent complications?",
			answer: `The best way to prevent complications is to keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol in your target ranges. Eat healthy, stay active, take medications as prescribed, manage stress, and avoid smoking. Regular checkups and monitoring can help catch problems early. Managing your diabetes every day may seem hard, but it makes a huge difference in your long-term health.`,
